    - After familiarizing myself with the team's processes and procedures, I wrote a white paper on recommendations for improvements.  The improvements were taken under advisement and I was given permission to implement the majority of the improvements.
    - I used Puppet to automate the setup of developer workstations for onboarding new individuals.  This improved the time a new developer was prepared to learn the system from 2 weeks to less than a day.
    - I used both Puppet and a cloud deployment framework to bring both the developer workstation and our systems configuration under configuration management and automated deployment.  This allowed for automation of 70% of system setup for our tools and improved development into a new environment from 6 work days to 25 minutes for the 70% that was brought under automation and configuration management. 
    - Using Maven and Bamboo, I redesigned the system artifacts to become proper Software Configuration Items (SWCIs) to move the team closer to the CMMI and government goals for the project. 
    - Used Spring, Apache Camel, and OracleAQ to implement a multithreaded, redundant biometric system.
    - Decompiled a third party library with a GUI to leverage it in the use of a command line tool to automate its use.
    - Used Spring to create a stand-alone tool for the customer to leverage system components for a significant system enhancement for a two day turnaround.
    - Used Python to manage 100+ disparate servers.  Allowing for quick deployment and fast testing of the code base and environmental synchronization between development, test, and quality assurance environments.
