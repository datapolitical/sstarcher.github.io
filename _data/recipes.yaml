  directions:
  - "1. Heat olive oil in a large, deep skillet or straight-sided saut\xE9 pan over\
    \ high heat until shimmering. Add onion, red pepper, and chili and spread into\
    \ an even layer. Cook, without moving, until vegetables on the bottom are deeply\
    \ browned and beginning to char in spots, about 6 minutes. Stir and repeat. Continue\
    \ to cook until vegetables are fully softened and spottily charred, about another\
    \ 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, about\
    \ 30 seconds. Add paprika and cumin and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about\
    \ 30 seconds. Immediately add tomatoes and stir to combine (see note). Reduce\
    \ heat to a bare simmer and simmer for 10 minutes, then season to taste with salt\
    \ and pepper and stir in half of cilantro or parsley."
  - 2. Using a large spoon, make a well near the perimeter of the pan and break an
    egg directly into it. Spoon a little sauce over edges of egg white to partially
    submerge and contain it, leaving yolk exposed. Repeat with remaining 5 eggs, working
    around pan as you go. Season eggs with a little salt, cover, reduce heat to lowest
    setting, and cook until egg whites are barely set and yolks are still runny, 5
    to 8 minutes.
  - 3. Sprinkle with remaining cilantro or parsley, along with any of the optional
    toppings. Serve immediately with crusty bread.

  directions:
  - Shake together all sauce ingredients and set aside.
  - Slice the flank steak against the grain into 1/4 inch thick slices.
  - Working in two batches, toss the steak in the cornstarch and allow it to sit for
    10 minutes.
  - Heat 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. I preferred
    my ceramic non-stick pan over a stainless steel skillet.
  - Working in 3 batches, cook the beef for 2 minutes per side, or until lightly browned.
    Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate while you work on the other batches.
  - After all the beef is cooked, carefully wipe excess oil from the pan with a paper
    towel. Pour the sauce into the pan, return the beef and simmer for 1-2 minutes,
    until thickened.
  - Scatter green onions over the beef and enjoy.
  - Meal Prep
  - To serve as a meal prep lunch, cook the broccoli for 5-7 minutes in the pan before
    cooking the beef.
  - Divide the rice, broccoli and Mongolian beef between four 2-cup capacity storage
    containers.
  - Storage- store in the fridge for up to 4 days.
  - Reheat- heat in the microwave until steaming hot.

  directions:
  - 'For the onions:'
  - Soak the onions in milk for about 5 - 10 minutes.
  - In the mean time, whisk together the flour, salt and pepper in a bowl. When the
    onions are soaked coat them in the flour mixture.
  - Heat about 1/2 an inch of oil in a deep skillet, over medium-high heat. When hot
    fry the onions in batches until golden brown. Remove from oil and drain on a plate
    covered with paper towel.
  - 'For the green beans:'
  - Bring a pot of water to a boil, and boil the green beans for just 5 minutes. Drain
    and rinse with very cold water and set aside. The cold water helps keeps the bean
    bright green and pretty.
  - "Heat vegan butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, salt\
    \ and pepper and saut\xE9 for about 5 minutes until the mushrooms have shrunken\
    \ and mushroom juices appear. Add garlic and nutmeg and cook for another minute."
  - Sprinkle flour over the mushrooms, stir and cook for another minute. Stir in the
    vegetable broth, coconut milk, and non-dairy milk. Cook for about 10 minutes until
    sauce has thickened to a creamy consistency that sticks tothe back of a spoon.
    Add in the green beans and heat through.
  - Top with onions and serve hot.
  - In a medium sauce pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Toss in the carrots,
    agave and brown sugar. Cover and let cook for 10 - 15 minutes giving them a stir
    every now and then, until carrots are fork tender. Add the thyme and lemon juice,
    stir to combine, and serve.
  - Cover the potatoes with water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20
    until they are fork tender.
  - In the meantime, in a medium saucepan, combine the garlic, non-dairy milk and
    coconut milk. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes.
  - When your potatoes are cooked, drain, and return the potatoes to the pot. Mash
    and add about half of the garlic and milk mixture to the potatoes. Mix and add
    the remainder of the mixture until you reach the constancy you like. If you use
    all of the garlic and milk mixture and you would still like the potatoes softer,
    just add more coconut milk or non-dairy milk. Season with salt and serve.
  - Add all of the ingredients to a medium sauce pan. Bring to a simmer and cook for
    10-15 minutes, until the cranberries have popped and it looks all saucy and delicious.
    It will be thin, but will thicken as it cools.
  - Preheat your oven to 425F (220C).
  - Toss the Brussel sprouts with the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic and salt.
  - Spread on a baking sheet and bake for about 15 minutes until Brussel sprouts are
    cooked, and some bits are almost charred.
  - Preheat oven to 425F (220C).
  - In a medium bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Use a pastry cutter
    or a couple of forks to cut the butter into the flour until all the butter is
    mixed and the flour looks like fine crumbs. Pour in milk and stir until the dough
    just holds together. Don't over mix!
  - Lightly flour a clean surface and dump the dough on to the flour. Use your hands
    to pat the dough together and flatten until you make a disk that is about 2 inches
    deep. Don't use a rolling pin, you want to do this by hand. Use a biscuit cutter,
    an upside-down glass, or a cleaned tin can to cut out 8 biscuits, using up all
    the dough.
  - Bake for 10 - 15 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown.
  - "In a medium sauce pan melt the vegan butter over medium heat. Saut\xE9 the onion\
    \ in the butter until the onion is caramelized. If you're in a rush, you can do\
    \ this quickly, but the slower you go, the more rich the flavour will become."
  - Mix in flour and cook for 1 minute. Now whisk in the broth and cook until the
    gravy thickens. Add soy sauce or tamari to taste if needed, this will also make
    the colour a richer brown.
  - Preheat your oven to 400F (200C). Toast bread for about 10 minutes until it starts
    to brown. Check it to make sure it doesn't burn! Remove from oven and set aside.
  - Toast bread for about 10 minutes until it starts to brown. Check it to make sure
    it doesn't burn! Remove from oven and set aside.
  - Reduce oven temperature to 350F (180C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.
  - "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium high heat and saut\xE9 the onions,\
    \ celery, and apples until they begin to caramelize. Add in the garlic, sage,\
    \ thyme, salt and pepper and saut\xE9 1-2 minutes more until fragrant, then remove\
    \ from heat."
  - Stir in the bread cubes and 2 cups broth. Add more broth as needed until bread
    is softened but not soggy. Spread the stuffing into the casserole dish, cover
    with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 10-15 minutes
    until top is browned.

  directions:
  - 1. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered
    with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate.
    Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively,
    set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat
    for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.
  - 2. Whisk together garlic, rosemary, lemon juice, and olive oil in a large bowl.
    Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer half of mixture to a separate container
    and set aside. Add chicken to the large bowl and turn pieces to thoroughly coat.
  - 3. Place chicken directly over the hot side of the grill, cover, and cook, rotating
    the pieces occasionally (but not flipping them), until the chicken is almost completely
    cooked through and only a few pink spots remain on the top side, about 4 minutes.
    Flip chicken and cook on second side until just done, about 30 seconds. Transfer
    to a serving platter. Re-whisk reserved marinade and pour it over the chicken.
    Serve immediately.

    keep sauce loose, until pasta is perfectly al dente, 1 to 2 minutes longer. '
  - 'Continue cooking pasta until sauce thickens and begins to coat noodles, then
    remove from heat and toss in cheese and parsley, stirring vigorously to incorporate. '

  directions:
  - Add vegan cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, garlic, vegan parmesan cheese,
    salt, and pepper to a mixing bowl and mix thoroughly to combine.
  - Divide filling between two flour tortillas and spread into an even layer all the
    way to the edge. Top each with half of the fresh basil leaves (leaving one edge
    bare so the tortilla can stick to itself). Press basil down slightly to adhere.
  - Tightly roll up tortillas from one end to another, starting from the end with
    basil all the way to the edge, working toward the end that's slightly bare.
  - Once rolled up, squeeze gently to compact everything and lay seam-side down for
    slicing.
  - Use a serrated knife to gently cut tortillas into 1/2-inch slices. Between the
    two tortillas, you should have a total of 20-22 pinwheels (amount as original
    recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).
  - Arrange on a serving platter and serve immediately, or chill for up to 24 hours,
    covered in the fridge. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for 2-3
    days, though best when fresh.

  directions:
  - CHIPOTLE SAUCE
  - To make the dressing add all of the ingredients to a small bowl or jar and whisk
    until combined.
  - CHICKPEAS & SQUASH
  - "Preheat oven to 420\xB0F/ 215\xB0C."
  - Add the diced butternut squash and chickpeas to a medium sized bowl and pour the
    chipotle sauce over the top. Use a spoon to mix it all together until everything
    is evenly coated. Spread the squash chickpeas in a single layer out on a large
    baking sheet and place in the oven to roast for 35-40 minutes or until the squash
    is tender and caramelize on the outside. Halfway through roasting take turn the
    tray around in the oven and give everything a quick stir.
  - When the squash and chickpeas are almost done in the oven get the kale ready.
    Place the chopped kale in a big salad bowl. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil
    and sprinkle a small pinch of the sea salt over the kale and massage the leaves
    with your hands by lightly scrunching big handfuls at a time. This should take
    about 30 seconds before the leaves grow darker in color and fragrant.
  - After you have removed the squash and chickpeas from the oven, let cool for about
    5 minutes before adding to the kale. Top with the pepitas and toss everything
    to combine and enjoy.

  directions:
  - To prepare the potatoes, scrub them clean if dirty and rinse under running water.
    Remove and discard any nubby sprouting areas. Place the potatoes in a large Dutch
    oven or soup pot.
  - Fill the pot with water until the potatoes are submerged and covered by 1 inch
    of additional water. Add 1 tablespoon of the salt. Bring the mixture to a boil
    over medium-high heat and continue cooking until the potatoes are very easily
    pierced through by a fork (smaller potatoes are done around 20 minutes, and medium
    around 25 minutes).
  - "While the potatoes cook, preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and drizzle\
    \ 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over a large, rimmed baking sheet. Brush the oil\
    \ so it\u2019s evenly distributed over the sheet."
  - When the potatoes are done, drain them in a large colander and let them cool for
    about 5 minutes, until they can be handled safely.
  - "Evenly distribute the potatoes over the prepared baking sheet, and use a potato\
    \ masher or a serving fork to gently smash each potato to a height of about \xBD\
    \ inch. (Thinner potatoes are more crispy.)"
  - "Drizzle the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil over the smashed potatoes. Sprinkle\
    \ the garlic powder, onion powder and remaining \xBC teaspoon salt over the potatoes.\
    \ Finally, sprinkle them lightly with freshly ground black pepper."
  - Bake until the potatoes are nice and golden on the edges, about 25 to 30 minutes.
    Sprinkle them with chopped fresh herbs, and serve hot.

  directions:
  - 1. Cut the roasting chicken into pieces. Divide it into two thighs, two drums,
    two wings and two breasts.
  - 2. In a large saucepan over a medium heat, melt the cooking fat. Once melted,
    add in the chicken pieces and cook until golden brown on all sides. Remove the
    chicken and put aside until later.
  - 3. Add the onions to the same saucepan and cook in the remaining juices. Once
    they have sauteed and begun to brown, add the garlic and cook for a few minutes
    together.
  - 4. If you wish to add a thickening paleo flour, do so now.
  - 5. Whisk in the chicken broth. At this point you will be able to tell if the stew
    is too thick. If so, feel free to add more broth or stock, or even just water.
    Do so slowly while continuing to mix.
  - 6. Add in the vegetables and chicken, along with any juices from where the chicken
    was resting.
  - 7. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  - 8. Allow the stew to come to a simmer, and then cook on low, but still maintain
    the simmer.
  - 9. Cover and cook for approximately 30 minutes.
  - 10. Stir in the cream or coconut milk, green onions and peas.
  - 11. Cook for just about another 2 minutes and serve.

  directions:
  - Rinse ribs and dry COMPLETELY with paper towels.
  - Douse dry ribs with liquid smoke if using and rub it in.
  - Lightly coat ribs in olive oil.
  - Mix together seasoning and sprinkle generously over ribs, front and back. (You
    don't have to use all of seasoning mix)
  - Massage the spices into the ribs, adding more olive oil to help distribute the
    spices well if needed.
  - Place the ribs in a large ziplock bag or covered bowl and marinate in the fridge
    for 1-2 hours.
  - Preheat the oven to 250 F.
  - Place the ribs on a foil lined baking tray in a single layer.
  - Add another piece of foil on top to create a pouch for the ribs to cook in. Be
    sure to seal the edges of the foil so that it's tight and steam won't seep out.
  - Bake on the middle rack of 3 1/2 -4 hours. (Mine only needed 3 1/2 hours) Check
    on it after the 3 1/2 hour mark. The oven temperature is very low so you can afford
    to cook it a bit longer without worry)
  - When the ribs are done to your liking, drain off the excess fat.
  - Brush the ribs with desired amount of BBQ sauce.
  - Broil on low until the sauce is sticky. (this won't take long so keep an eye on
    it)
  - Serve hot and enjoy!!

  directions:
  - 1. Combine all chiles in a medium microwave-safe bowl and cover with water. Microwave
    on full power for 2 minutes. Remove bowl from microwave and allow chiles to soak
    for 10 minutes. Using immersion blender or upright blender, blend soaked chiles
    until smooth, adding soaking water as needed to keep texture loose.
  - 2. Melt butter over medium-high heat in Dutch oven. When foaming subsides, add
    onions and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until onions are softened but no
    browned, about 6 minutes. Add ground spices and oregano and continue to cook,
    stirring frequently, until aromatic, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add tomato paste, soy
    sauce, anchovy, Marmite (if using), and sugar, and cook, stirring frequently until
    paste begins to stick to bottom of pan, about 1 1/2 minutes.
  - 3. Remove pan from heat and add 2 cups of chicken broth. Scrape up any browned
    bits from bottom of pan with wooden spoon. Add ground beef and break up using
    whisk until mixture is completely homogeneous (no large chunks of beef should
    remain). Add remaining chicken stock and return to stovetop and set over medium
    high heat. Cook, whisking frequently, until mixture comes to a simmer. Cover with
    lid slightly ajar, reduce heat to low, and cook for 75 minutes, stirring occasionally,
    until mixture is thick and intense.
  - 4. Combine masa harina and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl and mix until homogeneous.
    Add masa mixture, hot sauce, and bourbon to chili and stir to combine. Bring to
    a boil and simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt
    and serve immediately on top of burgers, hot dogs, or fries.

  directions:
  - In a large saucepan, heat oil over medium heat; saute garlic 1 minute. Add rice;
    cook and stir 2 minutes. Stir in broth and herbs; bring to a boil. Reduce heat;
    simmer, covered, until rice is al dente, about 10 minutes.
  - Stir in frozen vegetables and beans; cook, covered, over medium heat until heated
    through and rice is tender, 8-10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in spinach
    until wilted. If desired, serve with lemon wedges.
  - Test Kitchen tips
  - The Arborio rice cooks up tender with a texture that is smoother than long grain
    rice.
  - A combination of fresh and frozen veggies make this soup easy to throw together.
    The pieces of broccoli and cauliflower are large, but cut easily with your spoon
    if you find them to be too big.

  difficulty: Easy
  directions:
  - 1. Parboil the potatoes in salted water for about 3-4 minutes, no longer.
  - 2. Meanwhile in a 375 degree F oven, heat a baking pan of sufficient size to hold
    your potatoes without crowding them. A glass or metal pan is fine, as long as
    it is well heated beforehand. This will help to prevent the potatoes from sticking
    to the pan.
  - 3. After parboiling, drain the potatoes and let them stand for 5 minutes. Then
    toss the potatoes with the lemon juice.
  - 4. Toss together so that the potatoes absorb the lemon juice.
  - 5. Add the salt, pepper, herbs, garlic cloves and olive oil.
  - 6. Transfer the seasoned potatoes, garlic and oil to the hot baking pan. These
    should sizzle as they hit the pan; a good indication that they will not stick.
    Roast the potatoes for about 60-75 minutes or until they are nicely golden brown
    all over, turning them every 20 minutes or so. After the first 10 minutes, give
    the pan a shake to make sure the potatoes are not stuck to it. The roasted garlic
    may have to be removed before the potatoes are finished as it generally cooks
    faster.

  directions:
  - 1. Adjust broiler rack to 8 inches below element and preheat broiler to high.
    Place poblanos, onion, tomatillos, serranos, and garlic on a foil-lined rimmed
    baking sheet. Place under broiler and broil, turning vegetables occasionally,
    until tomatillos are completely softened and lightly charred, about 10 minutes.
    Transfer tomatillos to a bowl. Continue broiling until poblanos are charred on
    all sides, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a separate bowl and cover tightly
    with foil. Continue broiling until onion, Serranos, and garlic are softened and
    charred, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to bowl with tomatillos along with any
    juices and set aside.
  - "2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and set oven to 375\xB0F. Add chicken\
    \ stock to bowl with poblanos and peel poblanos while submerged in stock. Transfer\
    \ flesh to bowl with tomatillos, leaving skin and seeds with the stock. Strain\
    \ the stock through a fine mesh strainer into the bowl with the tomatillo/pepper\
    \ mixture. Discard skins and seeds. Add cilantro to mixture. Set mixture aside."
  - 3. Season chicken pieces on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large
    Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add chicken skin side-down and cook
    without moving until well browned on first side, about 6 minutes. Flip chicken
    and continue cooking until lightly browned on second side, about 2 minutes longer.
    Transfer chicken to a bowl and pour off excess fat from Dutch oven, reserving
    any brown liquid.
  - 4. Add tomatillo/pepper mixture to the Dutch oven and scrape up any browned bits
    from the bottom. Using an immersion blender, puree mixture into a chunky sauce.
    Season to taste with salt and pepper. Return chicken to pot, bring to a simmer,
    cover with lid slightly ajar, and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about
    15 minutes. Meanwhile, wrap tortillas in aluminum foil and place in oven to warm.
  - 5. When chicken is cooked, remove from heat and transfer chicken to a large bowl
    using tongs. Allow to rest until cool enough to handle. Shred chicken into thin
    strips, discarding skin and bones. Add 1 cup of sauce, half of cheese, and half
    of Mexican crema to chicken and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and
    pepper.
  - 6. Remove tortillas from oven and unwrap. Spread 1/3 of the remaining sauce in
    the bottom of a 13- by 9-inch casserole dish. Dip each tortilla in the remaining
    sauce and stack on a cutting board. Working one tortilla at at time, place 2 tablespoons
    of chicken filling in a line down the center and roll up tightly. Place in the
    casserole dish seam side-down. Continue until all the tortillas and filling are
    used (the casserole will be tightly packed).
  - 7. Spread remaining sauce on top of enchiladas and lay the remaining cheese down
    in a line through the middle of each row of enchiladas. Cover tightly with aluminum
    foil and bake for 15 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until cheese is
    lightly browned and bubbly, about 10 minutes longer.
  - 8. Remove enchiladas from oven, drizzle with remaining crema, sprinkle with chopped
    cilantro, and serve immediately.

  directions:
  - "1. Adjust oven rack to lower middle position and preheat oven to 275\xB0F. Add\
    \ dried chilies to large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or stock pot and cook over\
    \ medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until slightly darkened with intense,\
    \ roasted aroma, 2 to 5 minutes. Do not allow to smoke. Remove chilies to small\
    \ bowl and set aside. Alternatively, place dried chilies on a microwave-safe plate\
    \ and microwave on high power in 15-second increments until pliable and toasted-smelling,\
    \ about 30 seconds total. Transfer to a 2-quart microwave-safe liquid measuring\
    \ cup or bowl. Add 2 cups chicken broth, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave\
    \ on high power until gently simmering, about 5 minutes. Remove from microwave\
    \ and set aside."
  - 2. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty Dutch oven over high heat until
    shimmering. Cook oxtails until well-browned on all sides, about 8 minutes total.
    Remove oxtails and set aside. Reduce heat to medium.
  - 3. Add remaining two tablespoons oil and heat along with onions and garlic and
    cook, stirring frequently, until deep brown and just starting to burn, about 10
    minutes. Add cumin, cloves, and oregano and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant,
    about 30 seconds. Add chipotle chilies, vinegar, and remaining chicken broth.
    Scrape up browned bits from bottom of pan, simmer until reduced by about half,
    then transfer entire contents to the jar of a blender.
  - 4. Add soaked chilies and their liquid to the blender along with fish sauce. Start
    blender on low and slowly increase speed to high. Puree until smooth, about 1
    minute. Set aside.
  - 5. Place beef chuck in Dutch oven. Add oxtails, bay leaves, and sauce. Bring to
    a boil over high heat. Place lid on pot slightly cracked, then transfer to oven.
    Cook, turning beef occasionally, until completely tender and a cake tester or
    metal skewer inserted into meat shows little to no resistance, about 4 hours.
    Discard bay leaves and oxtails (meat from oxtails can be eaten if desired). Transfer
    chuck to a large plate. Return Dutch oven to stovetop and cook, stirring frequently,
    over medium-high heat until liquid is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups, about 5 minutes.
  - 6. Beef can be cut and served immediately, but for best flavor, transfer beef
    to a sealed container along with liquid and refrigerate up to five days. When
    ready to serve, slice beef against the grain into 1 1/2- to 2-inch slices, then
    shred into large chunks with fingers or two forks. Return beef to a pot along
    with the sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook, gently stirring and folding until
    beef is hot, tender, and coated in sauce. Season to taste with salt. Serve immediately,
    piling the beef into warm corn tortillas with onions, cilantro, salsa, limes,
    or other condiments as desired. Alternatively, serve as-is with rice, noodles,
    grits, or cornbread.

  directions:
  - 1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Toss in about 3 tablespoons of salt.
  - 2. Meanwhile, pour 1 tablespoon of the oil into a large skillet over medium heat.
    Add the garlic and onions. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until
    the onions are translucent. Remove the vegetables from the skillet and set aside.
  - 3. Pour another tablespoon of olive oil to the now empty skillet, turn the heat
    to high, and then add the mushrooms. Season with salt. Cook for 10 to 12 minutes.
  - 4. Pour the sherry in to deglaze the skillet. Scrap the bottom with a wooden spoon,
    dislodging any browned bits. Cook for 2 minutes. Toss in the parsley, reduce the
    heat to medium-low.
  - 5. While the mushrooms are cooking, start the pasta. Cook according to package
    instructions, subtracting about a minute off the finished time. When ready, scoop
    out about a quarter cup of the pasta water and set aside. Drain the pasta and
    then immediately toss with the mushroom sauce. Add the water if it needs to be
    more substantial. Sprinkle with Parmesan.

  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 350\xBA and butter and flour two 9\" cake pans. Prepare red velvet\
    \ cake batter according to box instructions."
  - Divide batter among prepared cake pans and bake until a toothpick inserted in
    the center comes out clean, 30 to 32 minutes. Let cool slightly in cake pans,
    then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely. Using a serrated knife, level
    out tops of the cake so they're flat (save scraps for decorating!).
  - 'Make cheesecake layer: Line a 9" springform pan with parchment and spray with
    cooking spray. In a large bowl using a hand mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer
    fitted with the paddle attachment, beat cream cheese and sugar until fluffy and
    combined, 3 minutes. Add eggs, one a time, until combined. Add sour cream, flour,
    vanilla, and salt and beat until combined.'
  - Pour filling into prepared springform pan and bake until only slightly jiggly
    in the center, about 1 hour. Let cool slightly, then transfer to the freezer to
    cool completely and firm up before assembling.
  - 'Make cream cheese frosting: In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and butter until
    light and fluffy, then add powdered sugar and vanilla and beat until combined.'
  - 'Assemble cake: On a cake platter, place one red velvet cake. Top with cheesecake
    layer, pressing down firmly, then top with second red velvet cake.'
  - Using an offset spatula, frost cake with cream cheese frosting.
  - Garnish with red velvet cake crumbs before serving.

  directions:
  - Bring a pot of salted water to boil. Add potatoes, skins removed and boil for
    20 minutes until fork tender (you can stick your fork into the potato and it slides
    right out).
  - While the potatoes are boiling, Heat 2 tablespoons of the vegan butter in a pan
    over medium high heat.
  - When hot, add the onion slices in (the onions should sizzle), and reduce heat
    to medium so you don't burn the onions.
  - Swirl the onions around to ensure it's all covered, and allow to caramelise for
    15 minutes, stirring once every 5 minutes. The onions will be soft enough to cut
    through with the spatula, and will be very tender. If the oil in the pan dries
    up, add water 2 tablespoons at a time to help finish cooking the onions. Set aside.
  - Drain and place into a bowl. Using your potato mashed, mash the potatoes for a
    few seconds until broken up. Place the coconut milk and the remaining vegan butter
    in a bowl and microwave for 45 seconds until hot. Add to the mashed potatoes with
    the garlic and salt and mashed all the ingredients together with the potato masher
    until incorporated.
  - Fold in the caramelised onions into the mashed potatoes. If you have time, you
    can let it sit for a while so the caramelised flavour seeps into the mashed potatoes.
  - Serve with black pepper (optional) and an extra pat of butter.

  directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (232 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment
    paper, or line with foil and grease well.
  - In a large bowl, stir together the chopped cauliflower, onions, celery, and garlic.
    Toss with olive oil, poultry seasoning, sage, thyme, sea salt, and black pepper.
  - Spread the mixture in a single layer on the lined baking sheet. (You may need
    two sheets depending on the size. You want as many of the cauliflower florets
    and onions in contact with the pan as possible.) Roast in the oven for about 15
    minutes, until the onions are soft and cauliflower is starting to brown a little.
  - Add the fresh parsley and pecans to the pan, and stir everything together. Roast
    for 10-15 more minutes, until the pecans are lightly toasted, cauliflower is well
    browned, and onions are starting to caramelize.

  directions:
  - Season both sides of the chicken thighs with salt and ground black pepper.
  - Mix the honey, dijon mustard, soy sauce and chicken broth together. Stir to combine
    well.
  - Turn on the Instant Pot and set the mode to Saute. Add the olive oil when it's
    fully heated so the chicken won't stick to the pot. Pan-sear both sides of the
    chicken thighs, skin side down first, until the skin is a nice golden brown and
    the bottom part is nicely browned.
  - Add the garlic into the pot, follow by the honey mustard mixture. Cover the lid
    and select Manual and set to High pressure for 10 minutes. When it beeps, turn
    to Quick Release. When the valve drops, remove the lid carefully, add the chopped
    parsley. Change to saute mode and reduce the sauce for 1 to 2 minutes, if you
    like a thicker sauce. Serve with plain spaghetti or steamed rice.

  directions:
  - 1. Combine flour, yeast, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and whisk
    until combined. Add yogurt and knead with dough hook on low speed until dough
    comes together into a smooth ball. Dough should stick slightly to bottom of bowl
    as it kneads (add slightly more yogurt or milk as necessary). Continue to knead
    for 5 minutes. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise at room temperature
    until roughly doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
  - 2. Turn dough out onto floured work surface. Using a bench scraper or a knife,
    cut the dough into 12 even pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then place on
    a well-floured surface (leaving a few inches of space between each one) and cover
    with a floured cloth. Alternatively, place each ball of dough in an individual
    covered pint-sized deli container. Allow dough to rise at room temperature until
    doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
  - 3. Ignite a large chimney full of coals (about 5 quarts of coals) and spread evenly
    over half of the grill. Set grill grates in place, cover, and allow to preheat
    for 5 minutes. Scrape grill grates clean with a brush.
  - 4. Working with two to three balls of dough at a time, stretch with your hands
    into an oblong roughly 10-inches long and 6-inches across (you can use a rolling
    pin for this as well). Once you have two or three pieces stretched, lay them out
    on the grill above the coals. Cook without moving until bottom side is charred
    in spots and light golden brown. Flip with a large spatula, pizza pell, or with
    tongs and cook until second side is charred and browned. Remove naan from the
    grill and immediately brush with melted butter. Transfer the naan to a large plate
    and cover it with a clean dish towel while you cook the remaining bread.

  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 360\xB0F | 180\xB0C."
  - Place chicken thighs in a large shallow dish and season with salt; set aside.
  - In a large mixing jug, whisk together the honey, lemon juice, soy sauce, vinegar
    and minced garlic. Pour about 1/4 cup of the sauce over the chicken (or just enough
    to lightly coat each thigh) and rotate each thigh to coat evenly in the sauce.
  - Heat an oven-proof skillet over medium high heat; sear the chicken skin side down
    first until golden for about 5 minutes. Turn and repeat on the other side. Drain
    most of the excess oil from the pan, leaving about 1 tablespoon for added flavour.
  - Arrange chicken skin-side up in the pan; add the whole garlic cloves between the
    chicken; pour half of the remaining sauce over each thigh (about 1-2 tablespoons
    per thigh) and bake for 40-45 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and
    the juices run clear. The skin should be crispy and sticky.
  - While the chicken is baking, pour the remaining sauce into a small pot (or saucepan),
    and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat down to low and allow to
    simmer while occasionally stirring; lifting the pot off of the heat when the sauce
    bubbles up to the rim of your pot, and repeat the process until the sauce has
    sightly reduced and thickened (about 6 minutes).
  - Serve with the remaining sauce, lemon zest and slices, and sliced green onions
    (optional).

  directions:
  - 1. Sprinkle gelatin over chicken stock in a small bowl or liquid measuring cup.
    Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
  - "2. Combine 1 tablespoon salt, 1 teaspoon pepper, and half of paprika in a small\
    \ bowl. Season steaks generously on all sides with mixture (you may not need all\
    \ the mixture) and press with the flat of your hand to adhere. Heat half of vegetable\

    \ center of steaks register 115\xB0F at the thickest part for rare or 125\xB0\
    F for medium-rare. Remove from pan, transfer to a plate, and set aside."
  - 3. Add remaining vegetable oil to the same pan and add the mushrooms. Return to
    medium heat and cook, stirring and tossing frequently, until mushrooms have released
    their liquid and are just starting to brown, about 8 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon
    butter and pearl onions and continue to cook, stirring, until onions and mushrooms
    are softened and well browned, about 6 minutes longer.
  - 4. Add shallots, thyme, and remaining paprika, and cook, stirring, until fragrant.
    Add soy sauce, Worcetershire sauce, fish sauce, and mustard and cook, stirring,
    until mostly evaporated, about 30 seconds. Add any collected juices from the plate
    with the meat, followed by white wine. Cook until reduced to just a few tablespoons.
  - 5. Add broth/gelatin mixture and bring to a heavy simmer. Carefully pour off liquid
    into a heatproof cup or liquid measuring cup. Add sour cream to a medium bowl.
    Whisking constantly, slowly pour hot liquid over sour cream and whisk until fully
    homogenous.
  - 6. Return sour cream mixture to pan along with remaining 2 tablespoons butter.
    Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and season to taste with salt and pepper.
    Return steaks to pan until barely warmed through, about 1 minute. Remove from
    heat.
  - 7. Cook noodles according to package directions. When cooked, drain and return
    to pot, reserving 1 cup of pasta cooking water. Transfer steaks to a cutting board
    and pour the sauce, mushrooms, and onions over the noodles. Stir to coat pasta,
    adding pasta cooking water as necessary until it reaches a loose, creamy consistency.
    Stir in half of minced parsley.
  - 8. Thinly slice steaks. To serve, divide pasta and cream sauce evenly between
    4 hot serving bowls. Top with sliced steak, spooning a little extra sauce over
    them. Add a dollop of sour cream, sprinkle with remaining parsley, and serve,
    advising guests to remove large thyme sprigs as they find them.

  directions:
  - First, you're going to make the cashew cream sauce. Start by boiling the raw cashews
    in water for 10 minutes and then carefully drain the water out and discard it.
  - Put the cashews, unsweetened coconut milk, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, salt,
    and pepper into a high-powered blender. Blend on high until the cashew cream sauce
    is smooth and creamy. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
  - In a medium pan over medium heat, saute the diced onions in 2-3 tbsp of low-sodium
    vegetable broth until the onions are translucent. Add the chopped artichokes and
    garlic and saute for 2-3 minutes.
  - Add the cashew cream sauce that you made, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder,
    nutmeg, and nutritional yeast to the pan with the sauteed veggies and stir everything
    together.
  - Lastly, stir in the frozen spinach, mix it together, and let it cook for 10-15
    minutes or until hot and bubbly. The mixture will continue to thicken as it cooks.
    You can eat the dip just like this with chips or veggies or you can top it with
    vegan cheese and bake it in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

    Don''t skip boiling the raw cashews for 10 minutes prior to blending them because
    it helps the cashews to break down and boiling the nuts (or soaking for 2-3 hours)
    makes it easier for your body to digest.


    Do not use sweetened or vanilla-flavored plant milk, it will make the dip taste
    sweet instead of savory. My favorite plant milk to use is unsweetened coconut
    milk (from a carton), unsweetened cashew milk, or unsweetened almond milk.


    While you''re cooking the spinach dip, you may need to add more vegetable broth
    if it gets too dry. The dip should be very saucy and rich.


    Store the leftover vegan spinach artichoke dip in an airtight container in the
    fridge for 4-5 days or freeze it for a future snack.'

  directions:
  - 1. Place dried ancho and guajillo chilies on a microwave-safe plate and microwave
    until pliable and toasty-smelling, 10 to 20 seconds. Transfer to the jar of a
    blender and add chipotle peppers, orange juice, lime juice, olive oil, soy sauce,
    fish sauce, garlic, cilantro, cumin seed, coriander seed, and brown sugar. Blend
    until a smooth sauce has formed, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt. Transfer
    half of the salsa to a large bowl and the other half to a sealed container. Set
    aside the sealed container in the refrigerator.
  - 2. Add an extra 2 teaspoons of salt to the salsa in the bowl. It should taste
    slightly saltier than is comfortable to taste. Add 1 piece of steak to bowl and
    turn to coat. Transfer to a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag with the top folded over
    to prevent excess sauce and meat juices from contaminating the seal. Repeat with
    remaining steak, adding it all to the same bag. Pour any excess marinade over
    the steak. Squeeze all air out of the bag and seal. Refrigerate for at least 3
    hours and up to overnight.
  - 3. When ready to cook, remove the extra salsa from the fridge to allow it to warm
    up a little. Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit
    and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal
    grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes.
    Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting,
    cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate.
  - "4. Remove steak from marinade and wipe off excess. Place directly over the hot\
    \ side of the grill. If using a gas grill, cover; if using a charcoal grill, leave\
    \ exposed. Cook, turning occasionally, until steak is well charred on outside\
    \ and center registers 110\xB0F on an instant-read thermometer, 5 to 10 minutes\
    \ total. Transfer to a cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes. Slice thinly\
    \ against the grain and serve immediately, passing extra salsa, lime wedges, avocado,\
    \ onions, cilantro, and tortillas on the side."

  directions:
  - "Dice the onion and heat up a few splashes of olive oil in the pan. Once hot,\
    \ saut\xE9 the onions. You can absolutely use more onion, and in my opinion, the\
    \ more oniony the dish, the better. It adds a nice texture, and you can use less\
    \ meat, which embodies the true Indian spirit. Once onions are looking transparent-ish,\
    \ add the ground beef."
  - While the beef is cooking, cut your tomato in half. Set one half aside (for garnish
    purposes) and dice the other half. De-seed and finely chop the small green chillies.
    Chop half of the cilantro.
  - When the beef is browned and there are no visible pink bits, add the diced tomatoes,
    chopped peppers, and chopped cilantro.
  - Add two tablespoons ginger garlic paste and the spice mix, mixing until all ingredients
    are evenly distributed.
  - "After most of the liquid has cooked down, crack three eggs directly into the\
    \ pan and mix them in, so little white/yellow flecks are visible in the meat\u2014\
    this part should only take a few minutes. Once the egg has cooked, keep the pan\
    \ on very low heat. At this point, take a taste, and add any needed salt, because\
    \ you haven\u2019t done that yet."
  - Now begins the assembly process.
  - "Preheat oven to 350\u2109. Take the casserole pan, and spread a little butter\
    \ or ghee on the bottom of the pan. Add two parathas to cover the bottom of the\
    \ pan. Add a layer of meat, roughly a quarter-inch thick, smoothing it down with\
    \ a spatula or large spoon. Don\u2019t over-do it with the meat layer. If you\
    \ have extra, this meat mixture is a perfect sloppy joe mix, or a delicious fusion\
    \ dish just waiting for some crushed tomatoes and pasta."
  - Lay down another layer of parathas, and spread a couple tablespoons of mint chutney
    on top. Add another layer of meat, smoothing and patting down as before. Cover
    with a final layer of parathas, and brush with a bit of ghee/butter on top. Put
    the whole thing in the oven for 10 minutes.

  directions:
  - Preheat your grill for high heat direct cooking and rub the grates down with a
    wadded paper towel dipped in cooking oil (set aside to use again later).
  - Use a microplane to zest the orange and pulverize the garlic into a small bowl
    with the fennel fronds.
  - Slice the orange in half, rub lightly with olive oil, and place cut-side down
    directly over the fire. Cook for a minute or two until the oranges become deeply
    charred, then juice them into the bowl with the fennel. Stir in the white wine
    vinegar and kosher salt, then cover and set aside at room temperature while you
    make the burgers.
  - "Use the bread as a guide to cut perfectly sized watermelon burger \u201Cpatties,\u201D\

  - Toast the buns lightly, then top with watermelon, cheese, a few coarse cracks
    of black pepper, and a few spoonfuls of the gremolata. Serve immediately.

  - Place the cashews, milk, lemon juice, garlic, and salt into a food processor and
    blend until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
  - Drain the spinach and squeeze it to remove as much moisture as possible. Add the
    spinach to the food processor bowl, along with the onion and dill. Pulse until
    the ingredients are fully mixed.
  - Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 3 strips of equal length, and then cut each
    strip into thirds, making 18 squares. Place each square into the bottom of a muffin
    cavity, stretching it out just a bit by hand if needed so the corners reach a
    bit beyond the top of the cavity. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the spinach mixture
    into each puff pastry square. Fold the corners of each square inward and pinch
    then together at the center. Brush the top of each puff with a bit of olive oil.
  - Bake until the puffs are lightly browned and puffy, about 25 minutes. Remove the
    tins from the oven and allow them to cool a bit before removing the puffs. Loosen
    the puffs from the tin by placing a knife down the side, between the puff and

  directions:
  - 1. Pour stock into small small bowl or liquid measuring cup and evenly sprinkle
    gelatin over surface of stock. Set aside.
  - 2. In a large 12-inch cast iron or stainless steel skillet, heat oil over medium-high
    heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring
    frequently with a wooden spoon, until moisture has evaporated and mushrooms are
    deeply browned, 12 to 15 minutes.
  - 3. Add shallots, garlic, and thyme and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant
    and shallots are softened, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add wine or sherry, and cook,
    swirling pan and scraping up any stuck-on bits with a wooden spoon, until wine
    is reduced by half, about 30 seconds.
  - 4. Add chicken stock mixture, season lightly with salt, and bring to a simmer.
    Reduce heat to medium-low, add fish sauce (if using), and cook, stirring occasionally,
    until mushroom mixture is thickened to a saucy consistency, about 5 minutes. Turn
    off heat.
  - 5. Meanwhile, in a pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta. If using dry pasta,
    cook until just shy of al dente (1 to 2 minutes less than the package directs).
    If using fresh pasta, cook until noodles are barely cooked through. Using either
    a spider skimmer (for short pasta) or tongs (for long fresh pasta), transfer pasta
    to pan with mushrooms along with 3/4 cup (180ml) pasta cooking water. Alternatively,
    drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at
    least 2 cups (475ml) pasta cooking water.
  - 6. Heat sauce and pasta over high and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until
    pasta is al dente (fresh pasta will never be truly al dente) and sauce is thickened
    and coats noodles, 1 to 2 minutes, adding more pasta cooking water in 1/4 cup
    (60ml) increments as needed. At this point, the sauce should coat the pasta but
    still be loose enough to pool around the edges of the pan. Add the butter, and
    stir and toss rapidly to melt and emulsify into the sauce. Remove from heat, add
    3/4 of grated cheese and all of the parsley, and stir rapidly to incorporate.
    Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately, passing remaining grated cheese
    at the table.

  directions:
  - Cover the potatoes with water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20
    until they are fork tender.
  - In the meantime, in a medium saucepan, combine the garlic, non-dairy milk and
    coconut milk. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes.
  - When your potatoes are cooked, drain, and return the potatoes to the pot. Mash
    and add about half of the garlic and milk mixture to the potatoes. Mix and add
    the remainder of the mixture until you reach the constancy you like. If you use
    all of the garlic and milk mixture and you would still like the potatoes softer,
    just add more coconut milk or non-dairy milk. Season with salt and serve.

  created: '2020-06-13 18:49:30'
  description: ''
  difficulty: ''
  directions:
  - 1. With a sharp chef's knife, split chicken breasts in half horizontally. Working
    one piece at a time, place inside a plastic zipper-lock bag and pound with a meat
    pounder or the bottom of a skillet to an even 1/4-inch thickness. Transfer to
    a large bowl.
  - 2. Add 1 1/2 cups buttermilk and minced garlic to bowl. Season with 2 tablespoons
    kosher salt and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Turn chicken with hands
    until salt, pepper, and garlic are evenly incorporated and all the chicken is
    coated in buttermilk mixture. Transfer to a large zipper-lock bag, press out the
    air, and seal. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight (see note).
  - 3. Meanwhile, place bread slices on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Leave
    out on counter for at least 4 hours and up to overnight until mostly dried.
  - 4. The next day, break bread into rough pieces (leave the wire rack in the rimmed
    baking sheet) and combine with 4 ounces Parmesan cheese in the food processor.
    Season with black pepper. Process until bread is finely ground, about 20 seconds.
    Transfer mixture to a large shallow bowl or pie plate.
  - 5. Place flour in a second shallow bowl or pie plate. Whisk eggs, 2 tablespoons
    buttermilk, and 1 tablespoon of the flour in a third pie plate. Drizzle remaining
    2 tablespoons buttermilk over the breadcrumb/Parmesan mixture and incorporate
    with your fingertips. The mixture should be mealy, but hold together in clumps
    if you squeeze it together with your hands.
  - 6. Working one piece of chicken at a time, remove from the bag and add to flour.
    Turn to coat, shake off excess, and add to egg mixture. Turn to coat, letting
    excess drip off, and add to breadcrumb mixture. Turn to coat, piling crumbs on
    top and pressing down firmly so a thick layer adheres. Transfer coated chicken
    to the wire rack and repeat with remaining chicken breasts.
  - "7. Preheat oven to 425\xB0F. Place sauce in a medium saucepan and heat over low\
    \ heat, stirring occasionally, until barely simmering. Remove from heat and set\
    \ aside."
  - "8. Heat oil in a large non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat until\
    \ it registers 375 to 400\xB0F on an instant read or deep-frying thermometer.\
    \ Working in batches, carefully add chicken by lowering the cutlets away from\
    \ you into the oil. Add as many cutlets as will fit in one layer (2 to 3)."
  - 9. Cook, swirling pan gently and using a thin flexible metal spatula to loosen
    chicken if it sticks, until chicken is golden-brown and crisp on bottom side,
    about 2 minutes. Using a thin metal spatula and a fork, carefully flip chicken
    and cook until golden brown on second side. Transfer chicken to a paper-towel
    lined plate to drain and repeat with remaining chicken.
  - 10. Spoon 1/3 of sauce onto the bottom of a casserole or oven-safe serving dish.
    Shingle chicken pieces on top of sauce. Top with more sauce, forming a line down
    the center. Combine mozzarella and remaining 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese in a
    large bowl and toss to coat. Lay cheese mixture over chicken in a straight line
    down the center.
  - 11. Transfer to the oven and cook until cheese is melted and bubbly, about 20
    minutes. Remove from oven and immediately grate fresh Parmesan on top. Allow to
    rest for 3 minutes, top with chopped herbs, and serve immediately.

  - Drizzle on salads, tacos, rice bowls or grilled meats!

  - After blending all the ingredients together, I recommend letting the dressing
    sit in the fridge for at least 1 hour but preferably overnight to really help
    the flavors meld together. It makes a big difference and is worth the wait!
  - The dressing should be pourable and not too thick. If you want it thicker, blend
    in more plain Greek yogurt until it reaches the consistency you want.

    \ You can remove any large excess stems (especially if they\u2019re super long),\

  directions:
  - "Dice the onion and heat up a few splashes of olive oil in the pan. Once hot,\
    \ saut\xE9 the onions. You can absolutely use more onion, and in my opinion, the\
    \ more oniony the dish, the better. It adds a nice texture, and you can use less\
    \ meat, which embodies the true Indian spirit. Once onions are looking transparent-ish,\
    \ add the ground beef."
  - While the beef is cooking, cut your tomato in half. Set one half aside (for garnish
    purposes) and dice the other half. De-seed and finely chop the small green chillies.
    Chop half of the cilantro.
  - When the beef is browned and there are no visible pink bits, add the diced tomatoes,
    chopped peppers, and chopped cilantro.
  - Add two tablespoons ginger garlic paste and the spice mix, mixing until all ingredients
    are evenly distributed.
  - "After most of the liquid has cooked down, crack three eggs directly into the\
    \ pan and mix them in, so little white/yellow flecks are visible in the meat\u2014\
    this part should only take a few minutes. Once the egg has cooked, keep the pan\
    \ on very low heat. At this point, take a taste, and add any needed salt, because\
    \ you haven\u2019t done that yet."
  - Now begins the assembly process.
  - "Preheat oven to 350\u2109. Take the casserole pan, and spread a little butter\
    \ or ghee on the bottom of the pan. Add two parathas to cover the bottom of the\
    \ pan. Add a layer of meat, roughly a quarter-inch thick, smoothing it down with\
    \ a spatula or large spoon. Don\u2019t over-do it with the meat layer. If you\
