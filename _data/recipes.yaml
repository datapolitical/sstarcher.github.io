  directions:
  - "Preheat the oven to 400\xB0 and lightly oil 2 standard-size muffin tins. (You'll\
    \ need 18 cavities, so you can use 2 tins, 1 tin with 18 cavities \u2014 if you\
    \ can find it \u2014 or use a single tin but cook the puffs in 2 batches.)"
  - Place the cashews, milk, lemon juice, garlic, and salt into a food processor and
    blend until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.
  - Drain the spinach and squeeze it to remove as much moisture as possible. Add the
    spinach to the food processor bowl, along with the onion and dill. Pulse until
    the ingredients are fully mixed.
  - Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 3 strips of equal length, and then cut each
    strip into thirds, making 18 squares. Place each square into the bottom of a muffin
    cavity, stretching it out just a bit by hand if needed so the corners reach a
    bit beyond the top of the cavity. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the spinach mixture
    into each puff pastry square. Fold the corners of each square inward and pinch
    then together at the center. Brush the top of each puff with a bit of olive oil.
  - Bake until the puffs are lightly browned and puffy, about 25 minutes. Remove the
    tins from the oven and allow them to cool a bit before removing the puffs. Loosen
    the puffs from the tin by placing a knife down the side, between the puff and
    the tin.
  - Serve.

  directions:
  - Bring a pot of salted water to boil. Add potatoes, skins removed and boil for
    20 minutes until fork tender (you can stick your fork into the potato and it slides
    right out).
  - While the potatoes are boiling, Heat 2 tablespoons of the vegan butter in a pan
    over medium high heat.
  - When hot, add the onion slices in (the onions should sizzle), and reduce heat
    to medium so you don't burn the onions.
  - Swirl the onions around to ensure it's all covered, and allow to caramelise for
    15 minutes, stirring once every 5 minutes. The onions will be soft enough to cut
    through with the spatula, and will be very tender. If the oil in the pan dries
    up, add water 2 tablespoons at a time to help finish cooking the onions. Set aside.
  - Drain and place into a bowl. Using your potato mashed, mash the potatoes for a
    few seconds until broken up. Place the coconut milk and the remaining vegan butter
    in a bowl and microwave for 45 seconds until hot. Add to the mashed potatoes with
    the garlic and salt and mashed all the ingredients together with the potato masher
    until incorporated.
  - Fold in the caramelised onions into the mashed potatoes. If you have time, you
    can let it sit for a while so the caramelised flavour seeps into the mashed potatoes.
  - Serve with black pepper (optional) and an extra pat of butter.

  directions:
  - 1. Cut the roasting chicken into pieces. Divide it into two thighs, two drums,
    two wings and two breasts.
  - 2. In a large saucepan over a medium heat, melt the cooking fat. Once melted,
    add in the chicken pieces and cook until golden brown on all sides. Remove the
    chicken and put aside until later.
  - 3. Add the onions to the same saucepan and cook in the remaining juices. Once
    they have sauteed and begun to brown, add the garlic and cook for a few minutes
    together.
  - 4. If you wish to add a thickening paleo flour, do so now.
  - 5. Whisk in the chicken broth. At this point you will be able to tell if the stew
    is too thick. If so, feel free to add more broth or stock, or even just water.
    Do so slowly while continuing to mix.
  - 6. Add in the vegetables and chicken, along with any juices from where the chicken
    was resting.
  - 7. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
  - 8. Allow the stew to come to a simmer, and then cook on low, but still maintain
    the simmer.
  - 9. Cover and cook for approximately 30 minutes.

  directions:
  - 'For the onions:'
  - Soak the onions in milk for about 5 - 10 minutes.
  - In the mean time, whisk together the flour, salt and pepper in a bowl. When the
    onions are soaked coat them in the flour mixture.
  - Heat about 1/2 an inch of oil in a deep skillet, over medium-high heat. When hot
    fry the onions in batches until golden brown. Remove from oil and drain on a plate
    covered with paper towel.
  - 'For the green beans:'
  - Bring a pot of water to a boil, and boil the green beans for just 5 minutes. Drain
    and rinse with very cold water and set aside. The cold water helps keeps the bean
    bright green and pretty.
  - "Heat vegan butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, salt\
    \ and pepper and saut\xE9 for about 5 minutes until the mushrooms have shrunken\
    \ and mushroom juices appear. Add garlic and nutmeg and cook for another minute."
  - Sprinkle flour over the mushrooms, stir and cook for another minute. Stir in the
    vegetable broth, coconut milk, and non-dairy milk. Cook for about 10 minutes until
    sauce has thickened to a creamy consistency that sticks tothe back of a spoon.
    Add in the green beans and heat through.
  - Top with onions and serve hot.
  - In a medium sauce pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Toss in the carrots,
    agave and brown sugar. Cover and let cook for 10 - 15 minutes giving them a stir
    every now and then, until carrots are fork tender. Add the thyme and lemon juice,
    stir to combine, and serve.
  - Cover the potatoes with water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Boil for 15-20
    until they are fork tender.
  - In the meantime, in a medium saucepan, combine the garlic, non-dairy milk and
    coconut milk. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes.
  - When your potatoes are cooked, drain, and return the potatoes to the pot. Mash
    and add about half of the garlic and milk mixture to the potatoes. Mix and add
    the remainder of the mixture until you reach the constancy you like. If you use
    all of the garlic and milk mixture and you would still like the potatoes softer,
    just add more coconut milk or non-dairy milk. Season with salt and serve.
  - Add all of the ingredients to a medium sauce pan. Bring to a simmer and cook for
    10-15 minutes, until the cranberries have popped and it looks all saucy and delicious.
    It will be thin, but will thicken as it cools.
  - Preheat your oven to 425F (220C).
  - Toss the Brussel sprouts with the olive oil, balsamic vinegar, garlic and salt.
  - Spread on a baking sheet and bake for about 15 minutes until Brussel sprouts are
    cooked, and some bits are almost charred.
  - Preheat oven to 425F (220C).
  - In a medium bowl whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Use a pastry cutter
    or a couple of forks to cut the butter into the flour until all the butter is
    mixed and the flour looks like fine crumbs. Pour in milk and stir until the dough
    just holds together. Don't over mix!
  - Lightly flour a clean surface and dump the dough on to the flour. Use your hands
    to pat the dough together and flatten until you make a disk that is about 2 inches
    deep. Don't use a rolling pin, you want to do this by hand. Use a biscuit cutter,
    an upside-down glass, or a cleaned tin can to cut out 8 biscuits, using up all
    the dough.
  - Bake for 10 - 15 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown.
  - "In a medium sauce pan melt the vegan butter over medium heat. Saut\xE9 the onion\
    \ in the butter until the onion is caramelized. If you're in a rush, you can do\
    \ this quickly, but the slower you go, the more rich the flavour will become."
  - Mix in flour and cook for 1 minute. Now whisk in the broth and cook until the
    gravy thickens. Add soy sauce or tamari to taste if needed, this will also make
    the colour a richer brown.
  - Preheat your oven to 400F (200C). Toast bread for about 10 minutes until it starts
    to brown. Check it to make sure it doesn't burn! Remove from oven and set aside.
  - Toast bread for about 10 minutes until it starts to brown. Check it to make sure
    it doesn't burn! Remove from oven and set aside.
  - Reduce oven temperature to 350F (180C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.
  - "In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium high heat and saut\xE9 the onions,\
    \ celery, and apples until they begin to caramelize. Add in the garlic, sage,\
    \ thyme, salt and pepper and saut\xE9 1-2 minutes more until fragrant, then remove\
    \ from heat."
  - Stir in the bread cubes and 2 cups broth. Add more broth as needed until bread
    is softened but not soggy. Spread the stuffing into the casserole dish, cover
    with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and bake another 10-15 minutes
    until top is browned.

  - In a large skillet over medium heat, cook chicken in 1 tablespoon butter 4-5 minutes
    on each side until golden brown and cooked through. Remove to a plate and keep
    warm.

  directions:
  - First, you're going to make the cashew cream sauce. Start by boiling the raw cashews
    in water for 10 minutes and then carefully drain the water out and discard it.
  - Put the cashews, unsweetened coconut milk, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, salt,
    and pepper into a high-powered blender. Blend on high until the cashew cream sauce
    is smooth and creamy. The sauce should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
  - In a medium pan over medium heat, saute the diced onions in 2-3 tbsp of low-sodium
    vegetable broth until the onions are translucent. Add the chopped artichokes and
    garlic and saute for 2-3 minutes.
  - Add the cashew cream sauce that you made, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder,
    nutmeg, and nutritional yeast to the pan with the sauteed veggies and stir everything
    together.
  - Lastly, stir in the frozen spinach, mix it together, and let it cook for 10-15
    minutes or until hot and bubbly. The mixture will continue to thicken as it cooks.
    You can eat the dip just like this with chips or veggies or you can top it with
    vegan cheese and bake it in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.

  ingredients:
  - 1 1/2 cups raw cashews (Boil for 10 minutes or soak for 2-3 hours)
  - 2 cups unsweetened coconut milk (or unsweetened cashew or almond milk)
  - 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice (about 1 medium lemon)
  - 1 1/2 tbsp raw apple cider vinegar
  - 1/2 tsp sea salt (more to taste)
  - 1/4 tsp black pepper
  - 2-3 tbsp low-sodium vegetable broth
  - 1 medium red onion diced
  - 3 garlic cloves minced
  - (2) 14 oz cans artichoke hearts in water, rinsed, drained, and roughly chopped

  - 1 tsp onion powder
  - 1/8 tsp nutmeg

  name: Healthy Cashew Cream Spinach Artichoke Dip
  notes: 'Make sure to use raw cashews to make this dip so you can control the amount
    of salt that is in the spinach dip.


    Don''t skip boiling the raw cashews for 10 minutes prior to blending them because
    it helps the cashews to break down and boiling the nuts (or soaking for 2-3 hours)
    makes it easier for your body to digest.


    Do not use sweetened or vanilla-flavored plant milk, it will make the dip taste
    sweet instead of savory. My favorite plant milk to use is unsweetened coconut
    milk (from a carton), unsweetened cashew milk, or unsweetened almond milk.


    While you''re cooking the spinach dip, you may need to add more vegetable broth
    if it gets too dry. The dip should be very saucy and rich.


    Store the leftover vegan spinach artichoke dip in an airtight container in the
    fridge for 4-5 days or freeze it for a future snack.'

  directions:
  - Season both sides of the chicken thighs with salt and ground black pepper.
  - Mix the honey, dijon mustard, soy sauce and chicken broth together. Stir to combine
    well.
  - Turn on the Instant Pot and set the mode to Saute. Add the olive oil when it's
    fully heated so the chicken won't stick to the pot. Pan-sear both sides of the
    chicken thighs, skin side down first, until the skin is a nice golden brown and
    the bottom part is nicely browned.
  - Add the garlic into the pot, follow by the honey mustard mixture. Cover the lid
    and select Manual and set to High pressure for 10 minutes. When it beeps, turn
    to Quick Release. When the valve drops, remove the lid carefully, add the chopped
    parsley. Change to saute mode and reduce the sauce for 1 to 2 minutes, if you
    like a thicker sauce. Serve with plain spaghetti or steamed rice.

  directions:
  - Shake together all sauce ingredients and set aside.
  - Slice the flank steak against the grain into 1/4 inch thick slices.
  - Working in two batches, toss the steak in the cornstarch and allow it to sit for
    10 minutes.
  - Heat 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. I preferred
    my ceramic non-stick pan over a stainless steel skillet.
  - Working in 3 batches, cook the beef for 2 minutes per side, or until lightly browned.
    Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate while you work on the other batches.
  - After all the beef is cooked, carefully wipe excess oil from the pan with a paper
    towel. Pour the sauce into the pan, return the beef and simmer for 1-2 minutes,
    until thickened.
  - Scatter green onions over the beef and enjoy.
  - Meal Prep
  - To serve as a meal prep lunch, cook the broccoli for 5-7 minutes in the pan before
    cooking the beef.
  - Divide the rice, broccoli and Mongolian beef between four 2-cup capacity storage
    containers.
  - Storage- store in the fridge for up to 4 days.
  - Reheat- heat in the microwave until steaming hot.

  directions:
  - "Preheat oven to 360\xB0F | 180\xB0C."
  - Place chicken thighs in a large shallow dish and season with salt; set aside.
  - In a large mixing jug, whisk together the honey, lemon juice, soy sauce, vinegar
    and minced garlic. Pour about 1/4 cup of the sauce over the chicken (or just enough
    to lightly coat each thigh) and rotate each thigh to coat evenly in the sauce.
  - Heat an oven-proof skillet over medium high heat; sear the chicken skin side down
    first until golden for about 5 minutes. Turn and repeat on the other side. Drain
    most of the excess oil from the pan, leaving about 1 tablespoon for added flavour.
  - Arrange chicken skin-side up in the pan; add the whole garlic cloves between the
    chicken; pour half of the remaining sauce over each thigh (about 1-2 tablespoons
    per thigh) and bake for 40-45 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and
    the juices run clear. The skin should be crispy and sticky.
  - While the chicken is baking, pour the remaining sauce into a small pot (or saucepan),
    and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat down to low and allow to
    simmer while occasionally stirring; lifting the pot off of the heat when the sauce
    bubbles up to the rim of your pot, and repeat the process until the sauce has
    sightly reduced and thickened (about 6 minutes).
  - Serve with the remaining sauce, lemon zest and slices, and sliced green onions
    (optional).

  directions:
  - 1. In a medium saucepan of boiling salted water, cook penne until just short of
    al dente, about 1 minute less than the package recommends.
  - 2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, combine oil, garlic, and pepper flakes. Cook
    over medium heat until garlic is very lightly golden, about 5 minutes. (Adjust
    heat as necessary to keep it gently sizzling.)
  - 3. Add tomatoes, stir to combine, and bring to a bare simmer. When pasta is ready,
    transfer it to sauce using a strainer or slotted spoon. (Alternatively, drain
    pasta through a colander, reserving 1 cup of cooking water. Add drained pasta
    to sauce.)
  - 4. Add about 1/4 cup pasta water to sauce and increase heat to bring pasta and
    sauce to a vigorous simmer. Cook, stirring and shaking the pan and adding more
    pasta water as necessary to keep sauce loose, until pasta is perfectly al dente,
    1 to 2 minutes longer. (The pasta will cook more slowly in the sauce than it did
    in the water.)
  - 5. Continue cooking pasta until sauce thickens and begins to coat noodles, then
    remove from heat and toss in cheese and parsley, stirring vigorously to incorporate.
    Stir in a drizzle of fresh olive oil, if desired. Season with salt and serve right
    away, passing more cheese at the table.

  directions:
  - 'Combine all ingredients for the chili in the bowl of a slow-cooker and give it
    a stir to combine. Cook until the beans are tender and chicken falls apart easily,
    3-4 hours on high or 7-8 hours on low. (Note: dried beans can vary in cook time
    depending on how long they''ve been stored, so plan for the higher end of the
    cook time range if you think yours might have sat on the shelf for a bit.)'
  - Shred the chicken with a fork, allowing some large pieces to remain. Season with
    salt and pepper. (If you want a creamier chili, you can stir in 1/3 cup sour cream
    or plain yogurt.)
  - Ladle soup in to bowls and serve with any (or all!) the toppings you like.

  directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (232 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment
    paper, or line with foil and grease well.
  - In a large bowl, stir together the chopped cauliflower, onions, celery, and garlic.
    Toss with olive oil, poultry seasoning, sage, thyme, sea salt, and black pepper.
  - Spread the mixture in a single layer on the lined baking sheet. (You may need
    two sheets depending on the size. You want as many of the cauliflower florets
    and onions in contact with the pan as possible.) Roast in the oven for about 15
    minutes, until the onions are soft and cauliflower is starting to brown a little.
  - Add the fresh parsley and pecans to the pan, and stir everything together. Roast
    for 10-15 more minutes, until the pecans are lightly toasted, cauliflower is well
    browned, and onions are starting to caramelize.

  directions:
  - Add vegan cream cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach, garlic, vegan parmesan cheese,
    salt, and pepper to a mixing bowl and mix thoroughly to combine.
  - Divide filling between two flour tortillas and spread into an even layer all the
    way to the edge. Top each with half of the fresh basil leaves (leaving one edge
    bare so the tortilla can stick to itself). Press basil down slightly to adhere.
  - Tightly roll up tortillas from one end to another, starting from the end with
    basil all the way to the edge, working toward the end that's slightly bare.
  - Once rolled up, squeeze gently to compact everything and lay seam-side down for
    slicing.
  - Use a serrated knife to gently cut tortillas into 1/2-inch slices. Between the
    two tortillas, you should have a total of 20-22 pinwheels (amount as original
    recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size).
  - Arrange on a serving platter and serve immediately, or chill for up to 24 hours,
    covered in the fridge. Leftovers keep well in the refrigerator, covered, for 2-3
    days, though best when fresh.

  - The Arborio rice cooks up tender with a texture that is smoother than long grain
    rice.
  - A combination of fresh and frozen veggies make this soup easy to throw together.
    The pieces of broccoli and cauliflower are large, but cut easily with your spoon
    if you find them to be too big.

  directions:
  - 1. Parboil the potatoes in salted water for about 3-4 minutes, no longer.
  - 2. Meanwhile in a 375 degree F oven, heat a baking pan of sufficient size to hold
    your potatoes without crowding them. A glass or metal pan is fine, as long as
    it is well heated beforehand. This will help to prevent the potatoes from sticking
    to the pan.
  - 3. After parboiling, drain the potatoes and let them stand for 5 minutes. Then
    toss the potatoes with the lemon juice.
  - 4. Toss together so that the potatoes absorb the lemon juice.
  - 5. Add the salt, pepper, herbs, garlic cloves and olive oil.
  - 6. Transfer the seasoned potatoes, garlic and oil to the hot baking pan. These
    should sizzle as they hit the pan; a good indication that they will not stick.
    Roast the potatoes for about 60-75 minutes or until they are nicely golden brown
    all over, turning them every 20 minutes or so. After the first 10 minutes, give
    the pan a shake to make sure the potatoes are not stuck to it. The roasted garlic
    may have to be removed before the potatoes are finished as it generally cooks
    faster.

  - "Preheat oven to 425\xB0F."
  - Place broccoli on rimmed sheet pan and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Sprinkle
    with salt and pepper, toss with spatula so broccoli is coated with oil.
  - Prepare three shallow bowls for breading the chicken. In the first, place flour,
    salt, pepper, garlic powder. Stir to combine. In the second bowl, beat the egg.
    In the third bowl, mix together panko bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and oregano.
  - "Place chicken on a cutting board and top with wax paper or plastic wrap. Using\
    \ a meat mallet or a rolling pin, flatten chicken to about 1/2 inch \u2014 the\
    \ key is that you want it to have even thickness."
  - Take one piece of chicken and coat in flour mixture, then dip in egg mixture.
    Let excess drip off and then dip in panko and Parmesan mixture. Place on baking
    sheet with broccoli. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts.

    for 10 minutes more. Remove from oven and carefully add marinara sauce and mozzarella
    cheese to the top of each chicken breast. Return to oven for 5 minutes or until
    cheese is melted.

  directions:
  - "Dice the onion and heat up a few splashes of olive oil in the pan. Once hot,\
    \ saut\xE9 the onions. You can absolutely use more onion, and in my opinion, the\
    \ more oniony the dish, the better. It adds a nice texture, and you can use less\
    \ meat, which embodies the true Indian spirit. Once onions are looking transparent-ish,\
    \ add the ground beef."
  - While the beef is cooking, cut your tomato in half. Set one half aside (for garnish
    purposes) and dice the other half. De-seed and finely chop the small green chillies.
    Chop half of the cilantro.
  - When the beef is browned and there are no visible pink bits, add the diced tomatoes,
    chopped peppers, and chopped cilantro.
  - Add two tablespoons ginger garlic paste and the spice mix, mixing until all ingredients
    are evenly distributed.
  - "After most of the liquid has cooked down, crack three eggs directly into the\
    \ pan and mix them in, so little white/yellow flecks are visible in the meat\u2014\
    this part should only take a few minutes. Once the egg has cooked, keep the pan\
    \ on very low heat. At this point, take a taste, and add any needed salt, because\
    \ you haven\u2019t done that yet."
  - Now begins the assembly process.
  - "Preheat oven to 350\u2109. Take the casserole pan, and spread a little butter\
    \ or ghee on the bottom of the pan. Add two parathas to cover the bottom of the\
    \ pan. Add a layer of meat, roughly a quarter-inch thick, smoothing it down with\
    \ a spatula or large spoon. Don\u2019t over-do it with the meat layer. If you\
    \ have extra, this meat mixture is a perfect sloppy joe mix, or a delicious fusion\
    \ dish just waiting for some crushed tomatoes and pasta."
  - Lay down another layer of parathas, and spread a couple tablespoons of mint chutney
    on top. Add another layer of meat, smoothing and patting down as before. Cover
    with a final layer of parathas, and brush with a bit of ghee/butter on top. Put
    the whole thing in the oven for 10 minutes.

  directions:
  - Set a large skillet over medium heat. Add in the olive oil. When hot, add in the
    onion and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes, until it starts to soften. Add in the
    green peppers, jalapeno, corn, cumin, paprika, cinnamon, salt and cayenne. Cook
    for about 5 minutes, until the veggies are all tender. Add in the tomato paste
    and brown rice. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring almost constantly.
  - Add in the drained tomatoes, black beans and veggie broth. Give the mixture a
    good stir then bring to a boil. Turn down the heat, cover and let simmer for about
    10 to 15 minutes (or according to the time on the package directions for the rice),
    until almost all of the broth has been absorbed by the rice (and the rice is tender).
  - Remove the cover and sprinkle the cheese over the top (use the lower or higher
    amount depending on how cheesy you want it!). Recover and cook for about 1 to
    2 minutes, until the cheese is melted.
  - Garnish with the cilantro before serving.

  - Add the diced butternut squash and chickpeas to a medium sized bowl and pour the
    chipotle sauce over the top. Use a spoon to mix it all together until everything
    is evenly coated. Spread the squash chickpeas in a single layer out on a large
    baking sheet and place in the oven to roast for 35-40 minutes or until the squash
    is tender and caramelize on the outside. Halfway through roasting take turn the
    tray around in the oven and give everything a quick stir.
  - When the squash and chickpeas are almost done in the oven get the kale ready.
    Place the chopped kale in a big salad bowl. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of olive oil
    and sprinkle a small pinch of the sea salt over the kale and massage the leaves
    with your hands by lightly scrunching big handfuls at a time. This should take
    about 30 seconds before the leaves grow darker in color and fragrant.
  - After you have removed the squash and chickpeas from the oven, let cool for about
    5 minutes before adding to the kale. Top with the pepitas and toss everything
    to combine and enjoy.

  directions:
  - "Dice the onion and heat up a few splashes of olive oil in the pan. Once hot,\
    \ saut\xE9 the onions. You can absolutely use more onion, and in my opinion, the\
    \ more oniony the dish, the better. It adds a nice texture, and you can use less\
    \ meat, which embodies the true Indian spirit. Once onions are looking transparent-ish,\
    \ add the ground beef."
  - While the beef is cooking, cut your tomato in half. Set one half aside (for garnish
    purposes) and dice the other half. De-seed and finely chop the small green chillies.
    Chop half of the cilantro.
  - When the beef is browned and there are no visible pink bits, add the diced tomatoes,
    chopped peppers, and chopped cilantro.
  - Add two tablespoons ginger garlic paste and the spice mix, mixing until all ingredients
    are evenly distributed.
  - "After most of the liquid has cooked down, crack three eggs directly into the\
    \ pan and mix them in, so little white/yellow flecks are visible in the meat\u2014\
    this part should only take a few minutes. Once the egg has cooked, keep the pan\
    \ on very low heat. At this point, take a taste, and add any needed salt, because\
    \ you haven\u2019t done that yet."
  - Now begins the assembly process.
  - "Preheat oven to 350\u2109. Take the casserole pan, and spread a little butter\
    \ or ghee on the bottom of the pan. Add two parathas to cover the bottom of the\
    \ pan. Add a layer of meat, roughly a quarter-inch thick, smoothing it down with\
    \ a spatula or large spoon. Don\u2019t over-do it with the meat layer. If you\
    \ have extra, this meat mixture is a perfect sloppy joe mix, or a delicious fusion\
    \ dish just waiting for some crushed tomatoes and pasta."
  - Lay down another layer of parathas, and spread a couple tablespoons of mint chutney
    on top. Add another layer of meat, smoothing and patting down as before. Cover
    with a final layer of parathas, and brush with a bit of ghee/butter on top. Put
    the whole thing in the oven for 10 minutes.
